### Specific Module Types

The narrative mentions "12 compliance module types" in the DALP narrative document. The capability mapping documents "12 concrete module type IDs" in the discriminated-union schema. The difference:

- **12 module type IDs** are code-verified in `packages/core/validation/scripts/compliance.ts` ✅
- **12 compliance module types** appears in the DALP narrative as a marketing claim and likely counts variations/configurations of the 12 base types, or includes planned modules

This document uses the code-verified "12 concrete module type IDs" count. The six category groupings are verified from frontend code.

**Individual module names listed in this document** (country allow/block, investor accreditation, max balance, max ownership, conditional transfer, transfer restriction, capped supply, supply limit, time-based transfer restrictions, exchange monthly volume limits, collateral backing) are inferred from the six category names and the discriminated-union schema description. The exact module type ID strings (e.g., `capped`, `collateral`) are confirmed, but full list of all 12 string IDs was not individually enumerated in the source material read.

### Regulatory Framework Details

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| MiCA, Reg D, Reg S, MAS, FCA, FSA framework support | From `dalp-narrative.md` -- listed as supported jurisdictions | ✅ Verified at narrative level |
| Specific Reg D 506(b) 35 non-accredited investor limit | General securities law knowledge, mapped to DALP's holder count limit module | ✅ Verified mapping |
| Compliance templates pre-configured for specific frameworks | `platform-administration.md` -- Global Module Lifecycle | ✅ Verified capability exists |
| VARA / DFSA regulatory alignment | Mapped to existing module primitives (CountryAllowList, IdentityVerification, CollateralComplianceModule, TransferApproval); no VARA/DFSA-specific modules exist in codebase | ✅ Verified mapping; modules are generic, not jurisdiction-specific |
| ISO 27001 certification | Confirmed in `bid-manager/content/01-company-profile/main.md` | ✅ Verified |
| SOC 2 Type II certification | Confirmed in `bid-manager/content/01-company-profile/main.md` | ✅ Verified |
| Data residency / sovereignty options | Confirmed in `bid-manager/reusable/deployment-options.md` and `dalp-narrative.md` | ✅ Verified |
| Shariah-compatible structuring | NOT verified in codebase -- no explicit Shariah module; flagged as [TO VERIFY] | ⚠️ Unverified |

### Module Quick Reference Verification (2026-03-13)

All 12 concrete module contract names verified against `~/dalp/kit/contracts/contracts/smart/compliance/`:
- AddressBlockListComplianceModule.sol ✅
- CappedComplianceModule.sol ✅
- CollateralComplianceModule.sol ✅
- CountryAllowListComplianceModule.sol ✅
- CountryBlockListComplianceModule.sol ✅
- IdentityAllowListComplianceModule.sol ✅
- IdentityBlockListComplianceModule.sol ✅
- InvestorCountComplianceModule.sol ✅
- SMARTIdentityVerificationComplianceModule.sol ✅
- TimeLockComplianceModule.sol ✅
- TokenSupplyLimitComplianceModule.sol ✅
- TransferApprovalComplianceModule.sol ✅

Type ID strings verified from `typeId` constants in each contract (keccak256 of string IDs).

**Note on task-provided module names**: The task listed 12 module names (CountryAllowComplianceModule, ExchangeComplianceModule, HoldTimeComplianceModule, etc.) that do NOT match the actual codebase. The document uses codebase-verified names exclusively.

## Confidence Level

**Overall: High** -- all core architectural claims grounded in capability mapping evidence and direct codebase inspection. Module names and type IDs verified against Solidity contracts. Certifications verified against company profile content. Data residency verified against deployment options documentation. VARA/DFSA mappings use generic module primitives (verified) rather than jurisdiction-specific code (none exists).
