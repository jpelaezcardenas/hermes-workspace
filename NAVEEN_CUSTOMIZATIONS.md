# Naveen's Workspace Customizations

This file is the source of truth for every change made on top of upstream
`outsourc-e/hermes-workspace`. It is read by `scripts/upstream-sync.py` to
decide what needs review when upstream changes those files.

## How to use this file during an upstream update

When `upstream-sync.py` reports that upstream touched one of our files:

1. **Read the table below** — understand what our change does and which upstream PR it maps to.
2. **Check whether upstream merged our PR** — if yes, their version is at least as good; drop our local commit and use theirs.
3. **If upstream has a different/better solution** — adopt theirs, update this file, remove the local commit.
4. **If ours is still needed and doesn't conflict** — resolve the merge conflict keeping our additions.

## Custom files

| File | What we changed | Upstream PR | Decision rule |
|------|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| `server-entry.js` | Added `Cache-Control: no-store` on HTML responses so stale chunk errors never recur after a rebuild | Not yet submitted | Adopt upstream if they add similar cache headers; otherwise keep ours |

| `src/components/update-center-notifier.tsx` | Added Naveen smart-update card + conflict resolution modal with AI analysis | Personal customization | Keep always; upstream won't have this |
| `src/routes/api/harp-config.ts` | New API route: GET/PATCH for HARP config | Part of PR #626 | Adopt upstream's version if merged; compare feature parity first |
| `src/routes/api/personality-swarm.ts` | New API route: GET presets + POST apply personality to swarm | Not yet submitted upstream | Keep unless upstream ships a similar endpoint |
| `src/routes/settings/index.tsx` | Render `<HarpConfigScreen>` when `activeSection === 'harp'` | Part of PR #626 | Drop if upstream merges PR #626 |
| `src/screens/profiles/profiles-screen.tsx` | Extended wizard from 3 → 4 steps: added Personality + Swarm distribution step | Not yet submitted upstream | Keep; upstream doesn't have this feature yet |
| `src/screens/settings/harp-config-screen.tsx` | Full HARP tiered routing config screen + `CapWidget` for day/week/month cap selector | Part of PR #626 | Compare with upstream's version if merged — adopt theirs if feature-complete |

| `src/server/personality-swarm-store.ts` | New server module: personality presets + swarm distribution logic | Not yet submitted upstream | Keep; upstream doesn't have this feature yet |
| `src/server/tasks-store.ts` | Added `agent_state`, `agent_name`, `agent_action_at`, `source` fields to `TaskRecord` | Not yet submitted upstream | If upstream adds agent task fields, merge carefully — check field naming |

| `src/screens/tasks/task-card.tsx` | Added `AgentStateBadge`, `SourceBadge`, purple shimmer bar when agent is active | Not yet submitted upstream | Keep; upstream doesn't have agent-animated task cards yet |
| `src/screens/tasks/tasks-screen.tsx` | Added "Ask Astra" + "Add Ideas" buttons, adaptive polling (4s/30s), agent-active stats | Not yet submitted upstream | Keep; upstream doesn't have Astra review trigger in UI |

| `src/routes/api/sisters.ts` | NEW — GET /api/sisters: returns full sister list; triggers lazy bootstrap | Personal customization | Keep always |
| `src/routes/api/sisters-bootstrap.ts` | NEW — POST /api/sisters/bootstrap: force-bootstrap one or all sisters | Personal customization | Keep always |

| `src/screens/agents/hooks/use-operations.ts` | Added SisterInfo type, fetchSisters(), sistersQuery, sisterMap — exposes sister personality data to Operations UI | Personal customization | Keep; upstream doesn't have sisters concept |
| `src/screens/agents/operations-screen.tsx` | Split agents grid into AI Sisters + Agents sections; added Invite Sister button; passes sisterInfo to cards | Personal customization | Keep; merge carefully if upstream changes Operations layout |
| `src/screens/agents/components/operations-agent-card.tsx` | Added PersonalityBadge component + sisterInfo prop — shows role/tier pill on sister agent cards | Personal customization | Keep; upstream doesn't have personality badges |
| `src/screens/swarm2/operational-worker-card.tsx` | Added ROLE_TO_SISTER map + PersonalityBadge component — shows sister name/emoji badge per worker role | Personal customization | Keep; upstream doesn't have personality badges |

## HARP Routing (PR #626)

**Our commit:** `fccb0ada feat(settings): HARP tiered model routing config UI`

**Upstream PR:** https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace/pull/626

**What it does:** Settings page to manage HARP VM's tiered model routing config
(`harp-config.yaml`). Reads/writes the config live, shows all 5 tiers, blocklist,
global toggles, and auto-improve settings.

**Key design decision — multi-path auto-discovery:**
The store probes 6 paths in priority order so the feature works for any user
without hardcoding. The `HARP_CONFIG_PATH` env var overrides all.

**If upstream merges PR #626:**
- Their version may be identical (we submitted it) or improved.
- If identical: our local commit becomes redundant. Run:
  ```bash
  git rebase origin/main   # should apply cleanly, drop the commit
  ```
- If upstream improved it: adopt their version and drop ours.

## Personality + Swarm Wizard

**Our commit:** `f962f4bc feat(profiles): personality wizard with swarm distribution`

**Upstream PR:** Not yet submitted.

**What it does:** Extends the Create Profile wizard with a step 3 (Personality &
Swarm) where you pick a personality preset, customize the prompt, toggle swarm
distribution, and set per-worker personalities with role-based recommendations.
Astra is treated as the main agent.

**If upstream ships something similar:**
Compare their implementation. Key things to check:
- Do they support role-based preset recommendations per worker?
- Do they support the Astra-as-main pattern?
- Do they write `display.personality` to the correct profile paths?

## Upgrade decision cheatsheet

```
Upstream touched our file?
  ├─ Yes, and it's a PR we submitted → Test if upstream version replaces ours fully.
  │     If yes: git checkout origin/main -- <file> during rebase conflict
  │     If no:  manually merge, keeping our additions
  └─ Yes, but it's our local-only feature → Resolve conflict keeping our code,
        then re-run: python3 scripts/upstream-sync.py --apply
```
